## üîí Security Features

Phi-3 Offline Chatbot is designed with security and privacy as core principles:

- **100% Offline**: No data leaves your machine
- **No External APIs**: No third-party services involved
- **Session Isolation**: Each user has separate conversation context
- **Input Sanitization**: File names and paths are sanitized
- **Size Limits**: Prevents DoS via large file uploads

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Software Updated**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

2. **Secure Your Environment**
   - Use strong passwords for system access
   - Keep your OS and Python updated
   - Use a firewall for network deployments

3. **File Upload Safety**
   - Only upload files you trust
   - Scan files for malware before uploading
   - Be cautious with files from unknown sources

4. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for production deployments
   - Restrict access via firewall rules
   - Use VPN for remote access

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   # Always validate user input
   def validate_message(message):
       if not message or len(message) > 10000:
           return False
       return True
   ```

2. **File Handling**
   ```python
   # Use secure filename handling
   from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
   
   filename = secure_filename(user_filename)
   ```

3. **Session Security**
   ```python
   # Use strong secret keys
   app.secret_key = secrets.token_hex(32)
   
   # Set session security options
   app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
   app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True
   app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE'] = 'Lax'
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   # Don't expose internal details
   @app.errorhandler(500)
   def internal_error(error):
       app.logger.error(f'Server Error: {error}')
       return jsonify({'error': 'Internal server error'}), 500
   ```

## üîç Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Change default secret key
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up access controls
- [ ] Review file permissions
- [ ] Enable logging
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Set resource limits
- [ ] Review dependencies for vulnerabilities

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review security advisories
- [ ] Test backup/recovery procedures
- [ ] Audit access logs
- [ ] Check for unusual file uploads
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Update security documentation

## üö´ Known Security Limitations

1. **No Built-in Authentication**
   - The application doesn't include authentication by default
   - Add authentication for production use

2. **File System Access**
   - Uploaded files are stored on the local file system
   - Ensure proper OS-level permissions

3. **Resource Limits**
   - Large files can consume significant memory
   - Consider implementing rate limiting

4. **Model Security**
   - The AI model could potentially generate inappropriate content
   - Implement content filtering if needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Headers

For production deployment with Nginx:

```nginx
# Security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' http: https: data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Log Analysis

Monitor these log patterns:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual file upload patterns
- Large number of requests from single IP
- Attempts to access non-existent endpoints
- File uploads with suspicious extensions

### Automated Scanning

```bash
# Scan for dependency vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Scan code for security issues
pip install bandit
bandit -r app.py
```

## üîÑ Incident Response

### If Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Take system offline
   - Preserve logs
   - Document timeline

2. **Investigation**
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized files
   - Analyze uploaded files

3. **Recovery**
   - Clean system
   - Update all credentials
   - Apply security patches
   - Restore from clean backup

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security measures
   - Notify affected users (if any)

## üìã Compliance

While this is an open-source project, consider these compliance aspects:

- **GDPR**: No personal data is collected by default
- **HIPAA**: Not HIPAA compliant without additional measures
- **PCI**: Not intended for payment processing
- **SOC2**: Implement additional controls for SOC2 compliance
